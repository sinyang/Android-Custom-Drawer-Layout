# Android-Custom-Drawer-Layout
Custom Drawer layout that uses a relative layout as the base viewgroup, for allowing hidden drawer panels to be placed at any location on or off screen.

There is still alot of work to be done. Drawer movement based on user gestures have to be worked on, and the animation have to be smoothened out.

After that I will clean up the code quite a bit.

Anyone who comes across this is welcome to branch/fork and edit. However, do NOT edit the master fork
